# CS342 - Neural Networks Homework

This repo encompasses all homework from my course taken during my time at the University of Austin, Texas.

## About

Each homework has a "grader" provided by the course administration. My work is in the respective "homework" folder.

* Homework 1: You task is to estimate Ï€ given a bunch of uniform random numbers in the interval [0,1].
* Homework 2: In this assignment we trained a classifier, both linear and non-linear, to test if a point is inside a circle.
* Homework 3: The goal of this assignment was to classify images from supertux into 6 classes. We defined the compute graph of our multi-layer perceptron and the correponding loss function.
* Homework 4: The goal of this assignment was also to classify images, this time using a convolutional neural network architecture.
* Homework 5: This homework taught us about over-fitting and how to reduce it
* Homework 6: In this assignment we designed a network containing more than 15 convolutional layers.
* Homework 7: This homework focused on fully convolutional networks. We designed a network containing convolutional layers followed by up-convolutional layers.
* Homework 8: This homework focused on a simple image generation task. We used the new tux dataset and designed a model to upsample images.
* Homework 9: In this assignment we used a new tux dataset and designed a model to predict the users actions conditioned on their previous actions.
* Homework 10: In this homework we will trained networks to play Tux. We used a policy that plays games in pytux and improveed the policy as it played in two ways, predicting which action will lead to the highest reward and gradient-free optimization.
* Homework 11: This homework uses reinforcement learning to train networks to play Tux.
